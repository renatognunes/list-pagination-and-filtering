Treehouse Techdegree: FSJS project 2 - List Filter and Pagination

- The Project
The project implements functionally to display a list of students more organized and clean. 
The principal function added to this project is a pagination feature, which allows the user to navigate through a list of students using buttons. These buttons have assigned the max of 10 students each, which will be displayed on the page when selected.
In addition, I implemented a search bar feature, which allows the user to search for a specific student name.
This project follows the core principles of Progressive Enhancement.

* I also added a feature that when the input value of the search is empty or when you search for an empty value, the page will display all students. The idea is that when you leave the search bar empty, you remove all filters, which means there is no filter added to the list, so all students must be displayed. An empty search will result in basically 'no action'. 
Although, if you are navigating through the students using the pagination button and you click in 'search' with an empty value, it will bring you to the first page. This way, the Search button as also the functionality of a 'Home' button.
If the input value from the search bar is not found, a message will be displayed.  

Overall it was a very challenging project. I really enjoy building it :)
